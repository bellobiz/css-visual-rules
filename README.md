## Review

Incredible work! You used CSS to alter text and images throughout a website. Throughout this lesson, you learned concepts including:

- CSS declarations are structured into property and value pairs.

- The `font-family` property defines the typeface of an element.

- `font-size` controls the size of text displayed.

- `font-weight` defines how thin or thick text is displayed.

- The `text-align` property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.

- Text can have two different color attributes: `color` and `background-color`. `color` defines the color of the text, while `background-color` defines the color behind the text.

- CSS can make an element transparent with the `opacity` property.

CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the `background-image` property.
